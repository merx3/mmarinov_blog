            I'm an aspiring web developer in his early stage of his career. I've graduated IT and I have worked for the past 2 years at companies doing work related to web development using PhP, Laravel and, of course, HTML, CSS and Javascript, and before that I've also done some QA work. I'm looking forward to becoming a reliable and devoted developer and freelancer who can help people make the site of their dreams. My moto is “The black letters are read on a white paper”.

            In this blog I try to cover different little know-hows and guides to the daily challenges that new and veteran web devs face. It's mainly focused on working with laravel, PhP and front-end, but you could find some whimsy articles too. In any case, my goal is to help you learn a few things and get you to enjoy the world of web content creation.
